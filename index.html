  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hello, My name is Jaden Sims</li>
    <li>I'm a senior here at BSU and will be graduating this fall with a degree in CS and an emphasis in Cybersecurity.</li>
    <li>Currently I'm not employed doing anything related to Web Development.</li>
    <li>I haven't had any previous web development internships or jobs, but that's 
      mainly do to my major being more focused around Cybersecurity, so I never really considered any that were possibly available.</li>
