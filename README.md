# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is a simple website that displays some information about me with some small rule sets to stylize the webpage.


## How to run

- To run the website, simply clone the repository at https://github.com/SimsJaden/Module-2-Lab.
- Once its cloned, start the Live Preview server while load the copied repository.

- Once you've done those two things you should be able to view and enjoy the website.
